      "question": "When does my credit card get charged?",
      "answer": "For monthly payments if you choose the monthly billing plan, your account will automatically be billed every 30 days. In the event of a billing failure, you will receive an email. Our monthly payment cycle charges every 30 days, so payment won't be taken out on the exact same date of each month. For Yearly payments if you choose the annual billing plan, you will be charged every year after your initial purchase. You will receive an email 2 weeks before your year is up as a reminder that you will be billed. You can see when the plan renews automatically each month/year by logging in your account and going to you Subscriptions page.",

Click 'Confirm & stop renewal' to cancel your current subscription. If you change your mind, you can upgrade back to a Pro subscription at anytime here. If you're within the 30 days money back period after your first purchase, a refund will be processed automatically. When you downgrade to a free plan, we will not delete anything from your account.

      "question": "Do I need to UnInstall Anything?",
      "answer": "You can safely install on top of your current version. The installer will detect when it is necessary to uninstall the older version first, and it will offer to do it automatically. This is usally only needed when there have been some big changes, such as added or removed components. In most cases the existing version can be upgraded directly and all your settings are preserved.",

      "question": "Why does my browser claim that the download is not safe?",
      "answer": "After every new release there people who report that their browser or AV software blocks the installer and shows a warning that it is not safe. This is because these programs use a heuristic that marks any newly released file as suspicious. For example Norton AV reports new files as WS.Reputation.1, which means - not enough downloads yet for this file to gain the necessary reputation. If you can't figure it out or if you want to play it safe you can wait a few days until the new version has gained reputation and is added to the 'nice' list by the AV developers.",

      "question": "Why can't I upload a new profile picture?",
      "answer": "If you don't see anything on your user profile pages to let you upload user images then it's usually one of a few things. The permissions associated with the role you are using are preventing you from changing your profile picture. MyStartUp is not installed, or is not enabled on your server. Make sure MyStartUp has been included in your installation. You can check this by going to Site Administration > Server > MyStartUp info and looking for the version settings. This setting is chosen automatically every time you visit that page. Save that configuration page and go back to your user profile.",

    "question": "How does the search function work?",
    "answer": "The way our Search function works is dependent on an algorithm we call 'StartUpRank'. StartUpRank pulls the search results based upon a variety of variables such as the wording of your search, the content of your data, and profile descriptions and the popularity of profiles. Each profile has a 'StartUpRank' that is calculated by a wide variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to; the number of likes, reposts, and followers associated with specific accounts. All of these factors work together to give the most popular and relevant results for a search. For example, if an exact Profile URL was put into search, there may be profiles which have a wider network of popularity which will rank higher than an exact word match.",

    "question": "Why can't I access the profiles offline?",
    "answer": "If recently added profiles are not showing up in your saved Collection offline, first check your Offline Settings page. If you have enabled saving offline only over a Wi-Fi connection and are trying to save over a 3G or LTE connection, either connect to Wi-Fi or disable the 'Only save via Wi-Fi' setting. The profiles you have saved offline are temporary locally stored in your mobile device’s cache. This means that if you have reset your cache, you will lose what you have chosen to save offline. Please consider whether you are prepared to re-save your Collection for offline listening before resetting your cache. ",
